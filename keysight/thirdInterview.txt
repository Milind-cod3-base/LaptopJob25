3rd round expectations:

Note: 

	- Homework
		- (Walkthrough) How did u proceed with the homework?, show us your thinking
		
			- walkthrough
				- justify decision
				- discuss improvements
				- cpp implication
				- what other ways you could have done
					- might be its dedicated window if not dockable?
					
			ques: (Walkthrough) How did u proceed with the homework?, show us your thinking
			- I broke the assignments into two parts:
				- Assumptions: 
					- existing app: 
						imports vrml -> shows scene graph tree -> renders the 3d model with OpenGL
					- target language cpp is wrongly placed in requirements, it must be placed in assumptions.
				
				- Requested:
					- exploded view feature 
					- UI proposal (setup and steer)
					- class diagram
			
			- Extension of software via docking it:
				- Option to open it is in tools. (missed to mention this in the interview)
				- cleanest option with easy user flow integration
					- what could be other ways?
			
			
			- Hand drew the UI
				- Wanted to show whiteboarding skills
				- Could have done with online tools 
					- Ques: Name of the tools?
					- Ques: What elements of GUI or tools am I missing? Need to check net.
					
			- grok: https://grok.com/c/1da53d27-cb80-4748-ba76-c1bb94fd8825
	

			ques: Other widgets that could be used instead of currently chosen ones, why did u choose these widgets only?
			ques: Logic: 
					Non destructive explosion (backups, recursive offsets)
					modes (radial vs. axis)
					slider/factor normalization
			ques: What improvements?
				- Animation
					- How would you modify ExplodeUI to support real-time animation of the explosion?
				- Multi selection
					- allowing users to choose multiple nodes in scene graph tree
					- enabling targeted explosion on specific sub assemblies
				- Forgot to add close dock tab button. (WAIT MAYBE QTDOCKWIDGET ALREADY COMES WITH IT, NEED TO CHECK)
				- There is an error, if the slider is being moved and apply isnt click, WHAT WILL HAPPEN? WILL IT STAY STUCK? 
					THIS IS AN ERROR OR CORRECTION I CAN TELL FROM MY SIDE THAT
			ques: OOP principals used?
			ques: How does ExplodeManager handle recursive offsets?
			ques: Whatâ€™s the purpose of the originals map? over a stack or array?
			ques: Why non-destructive design?
			ques: How would you extend for multi-selection?
			ques: Explain C++ memory management in SceneNode.
			ques: What if VRML data is malformed?
				 - Use QMessageBox to display warning / error to the user.
			ques: What trade-offs did you consider when choosing QDockWidget over a standalone window?
			ques: How would you handle concurrent UI updates and OpenGL rendering to avoid race conditions?
			ques: How does your design ensure thread safety in SceneNode transformations?
			ques: What performance metrics would you monitor to validate the explosion logic efficiency?
		- Revise VRML format
		- Look into OpenGL
		- how to read and create class diagram
			- what tool did use for it ?
			- MADE A TINY MISTAKE: the composite class has the diamond next to it.
		- How does the steering works?
			- in radial, how does the offset are applied?
		- Could have removed the Apply button
		- How does each method mentioned in the class diagram is implemented? rough oral idea?
		- What are the major methods of the widgets used in the GUI?
		- Why did choose factor normalised between 0 and 1?
			- and how does the offset works if the multiply factor is less than 1?
		- Why ExplodeUI is a child of QWidget?
		- Can I use QStringListModel in my Homework's Combo box?
		- Mods:
			- practice with more requirements in the same problem set.
				- how can it be extended?
				- what widgets and classes would I need for new requirement
					- learn new widgets and extension
		- Implement the current homework
			- make a simple front end
			- dock the widget to right
			- use logs to log out whenever a widget is moved or pressed.

		1. Luca: https://www.linkedin.com/in/luca-alimonti-6b162535/
			- Technical Leader Specialist R&D
			- Looks less of a soft dev, but more of a senior acoustic person
			- VA One team
		2. Mathias Block (4years) : https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthias-block-0ba638/
			- germany, says darmstadt, may be he didnt update to frankfurt
			- senior softwre dev
			- VA One team
			
		
			
	- Qt 
		- What is QML?
		- What are the main modules of qt
			- eg. Qt core, widgets etc.
		- Qt different versions?
			- Qt 5 vs 6
		- Q_Object macro?
			- does it allow meta features? what is meta features?
		- Common practices
		- How did I or did I not I use MVC in my homework?
		- What does QApplication app (argc, argv) do in main function?
		- What is Qt test?
		- What data model to use and when?
		
		
		
	- revise C++:
		- look for them in secondinterviewprep.txt
		- Auto keyword
		- composition vs inheritence? (DONE)
		- What is RAII?
		- Difference between software design and architecture?
		- C++ versions 
			- pros and cons
		- Multithreading questions
		
		
		
	- Prepare about the company
		- Listen to andreas last meeting voice notes
		- Learn about VA One (DONE)
		- Ask grok about past assignemt interviews (DONE)
				
				
				
	- what was the word I missed with andreas meeting?



	- DSA revision
		- Design patterns and software architectures
		
		
	- Basics of git.
	
	
	- look into VA One product (Done)
		- what it does (done)
			VA One notes:
				1. AVA : aero - vibro - acoustic simulation
				2. Traditionally AVA sim is done after building prototype
					- VA One lets user do it in the design phase
					- saving effort, time , money , materials etc

		- look if they have a GUI (not mentioned,but got the general idea)
	

===========
Note:
- tell them that words like vibro-acoustic-simulation is not new to use
	- as i have done mechanical engineering.
	- tell them since u r familiar with both mechanical engineering and software 
	engineering, I can not only contribute to software components pf va one but also
	understand and contribute in a bigger sense. not only understand it technically 
	software wise but also understand the user requirements deeply and suggest 
	feedback ina more productive way or contribute to productive suggestions. 
	use mechanical engineering as a weapon
	
- Questions to ask in the interview:
	- What version of qt and cpp do they use.
