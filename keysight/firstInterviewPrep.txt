Preparation:

1. Intro: 
	- My name is Milind, I dont have a surname.
	- I come from India, and I currently live in Frankfurt.
	- I graduated from masters in AI for smart sensors and actuators in March this year
		- during whcih i learnt AI and how to integrate it with autonomous / self driving robotics
		- using python and cpp as tools
		
	- Worked for 23 months in simulation technologies as a Cpp developer in two different companies.
		- self driving software components and its simulation at avl
		- build edrive simulation software using Cpp and Qt at persystems
	- so not only i bring Cpp and qt simulation softawre development skills to this job role but also
	i bring AI skills from my masters
	 and hence i can contribute to broader vision and projects.
	
	- [During my masters: 
		- I worked as working student at avl for 9 months
			- developing cpp applications for self driving cars.
		- Then I did my master thesis at avl for 6 months
			- during which i developed simulation component of self driving cars using cpp
	- After that I worked for 3 months as working student at persystems
		- where i was developing a edrive simulation application for windows using Cpp and qt
	
	- And then since they liked my work, they extended my contract as a full time for next 5 months.
	- So , I would say not only i bring my cpp experince in this role, but also using my AI skills from masters i can 
	 contribute in other projects of the company as well. ]
		
	""My name is Milind. I’m from India, currently living in Frankfurt. I completed my Master’s in AI for Smart Sensors and Actuators 
	 in March 2025, focusing on AI integration with autonomous robotics using C++ and Python. As a 
	working student at AVL for 9 months, I developed C++ applications for self-driving cars, followed by a 6-month thesis creating simulation components.
	At Persystems, I worked 3 months as a student and 5 months full-time, building a simulation app with C++ and Qt. I bring C++ and Qt expertise, plus AI 
	skills to contribute to Keysight’s simulation projects.""


2. One challegnge/ or thing im proud of ?
	- STAR:
		Situation - A client required graphical node connections in Virtual Testbench for simulating electric components like inverters and batteries. 
		Task - Find a library and implement it for drag/drop/connect functionality. 
		Action - Identified Qt Nodes, integrated it into the GUI using C++ and Qt, enhancing user-friendliness. 
		Result - Improved simulation of e-drive components, making the tool more intuitive and efficient.

3. why do i want to work here?
	- they are leaders in simulation and integration of AI - my past exp with simulation tools and AI skills. - get to work in different 
	tech 5g , automotive, comms, quantum.

	- "I want to work at Keysight because it’s a leader in technology innovation, especially in simulation applications, 
	which aligns with my experience developing Virtual Testbench and ADAS simulations using C++ and Qt. The role’s focus on integrating real-world 
	physics and interactive UIs matches my skills from Persystems and AVL, where I enhanced user experiences and tackled complex engineering challenges. 
	Keysight’s global R&D team and emphasis on cutting-edge solutions in automotive, 5G, and quantum excite me, offering a chance to grow and contribute with 
	my AI and simulation expertise. Living in Frankfurt also makes this a perfect fit."

How to prepare:

	- for: 
		- simulation applications 
		- integrate real-world physics, interactive visualization, and responsive user interfaces.
		- want someone in Frankfurt.

2. go through the submitted cv - done
	- Leipziger Str. 33
	- education:
